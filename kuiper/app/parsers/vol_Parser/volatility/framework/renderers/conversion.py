# For vol3 devs:
#
# convert_ipv4 && convert_ipv6 are slightly modified versions of their
# counterparts from vol2:
#
#     https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility/blob/master/volatility/utils.py#L84
#
# Furthermore, vol2 used as overlay for ip addresses that made the conversion string based:
#
#     https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility/blob/master/volatility/plugins/overlays/basic.py#L156
#
# by using struct.pack with the given format string on data that was then gathered through .v():
#
#     https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility/blob/aa6b960c1077e447bda9d64df507ec02f8fcc958/volatility/obj.py#L439
#
# .v() for IP addresses would do obj_vm.read(), which returned a string, and struct.pack was called on it.
#
# This doesn't translate very well to vol3, since vol3 does have overlays so the plugins instead are retrieving the raw integers
# from memory. That is why convert_ip4 takes a 32 bit integer as its input and convert_ipv6 takes an array of shorts.
# This code has only been tested on Mac so far, but since the modified functions cleanly replace evaluation of data that used to
# be done by the overlays that plugins for every OS used, then I don't expect issues when vol3 linux and windows plugins use them
