#
# This will allow our users to override any component of any plugin without monkey patching,
# but it also allows us to clear out the plugins directory to get back to proper functionality.
# This offered the greatest flexibility for users whilst allowing us to keep the core separate and clean.
#
# This means that all plugins should be imported as volatility.plugins (otherwise they'll be imported twice,
# once as volatility.plugins.NAME and once as volatility.framework.plugins.NAME).  We therefore throw an error
# if anyone tries to import anything under the volatility.framework.plugins.* namespace
#
# The remediation is to only ever import form volatility.plugins instead.
